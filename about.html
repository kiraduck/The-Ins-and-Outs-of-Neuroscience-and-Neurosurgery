        <section>
            <p>Neuroscience is the scientific study of the nervous system. It is a multidisciplinary branch of biology that combines physiology, anatomy, molecular biology, developmental biology, cytology, and mathematical modeling to understand the fundamental and emergent properties of neurons and neural circuits. Neurosurgery is a medical specialty that deals with the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the nervous system which includes the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and cerebrovascular system.</p>
