00:00
We need to get my phd and, and go from there.

00:03
That's what I did. I got my phd and then did a post doctoral fellowship, and then, and then got a faculty position here at the University of South Carolina.

00:13
That's amazing. What who inspired you to go into the neuroscience field?

00:20
That's a number of people, um, some of the people that I worked with well after I have in the labs that I worked with after finishing my undergraduate degree.

00:30
They were very supportive, sometimes very challenging, but also always felt like I was learning a lot from them.

00:40
And so they were, they were people who supported, supported me, supporting me going on to the next bank, whether it was graduate school or post doctoral fellowship or whatever.

00:52
And then there, there's been some personal influences as well. You know, one of the things that I study is is cognitive function and aging and an alzheimer's disease.

01:01
And my mother suffered from a dementia later in her life.

01:06
And I so I experience that firsthand as as I seen a loved one suffer with that condition.

01:14
And that provided additional motivation, I think, to do what I do right?

01:20
And what, what skills do you believe every person or any student wanting to go into the neuroscience field as a whole should have?

01:32
So I think a couple of things that are absolutely essential are curiosity.

01:37
You need to be a curious person to become a scientist.

01:40
Because, by definition, what you're doing is you're you're exploring things that aren't known.

01:46
You're discovering new knowledge.

01:48
And if you're not a curious person that's not going you're not gonna have that motivation to to do the next thing to do, the next experiment.

01:56
Um, another thing is persistence. You you know, sometimes things don't work.

02:01
Sometimes you gotta knock on a few doors before a door opens to you.

02:07
And so just the ability to stick with something over an extended period of time.

02:12
And, and if something doesn't work, to to get back at it and and try something else.

02:18
So resilience and persistence are also key factors.

02:23
That's great. And what do you believe, um, that the skills you acquired through your job?

02:32
What skills do you believe you acquired while working as a professor?

02:36
Well, I-I think some of those same skills and then there's additional skills as well that that, work in a variety of professions but are important for for what i do um the ability to work with a wide variety of people That doesn't necessarily sound like something that's work for science.

02:50
Sometimes we think of scientists as people that are just kind of toiling away by themselves in a lab, and these weird individuals there occasionally come out of their whole and, but, but it the way science works, you know, especially in the modern world, is it's a very collaborative kind of endeavor.

03:08
You have to work with a variety of different people and people who working, where you're working, working in your lab, or people who are outside of your lab that you're collaborating with.

03:18
And so having those people skills, I think, is super important as well.

03:22
And the more that you develop in your career, um, having some leadership skills helps as well.

03:27
You're gonna be responsible for training people.

03:30
And so providing an environment where people can learn, where they can make mistakes and then move forward and find success is really important.

03:40
Well, um, do you believe that you are still having to grow in your profession?

03:50
Absolutely. I learn new things everyday and, and that's really important.

03:56
I think it ties back to that. That a trait of curiosity that I mentioned.

04:02
I think if you're a curious person, then then you approach everyday as as, what can I learn today?

04:08
And, you know, there's, and sometimes in science, as in any walk of life or any job, sometimes there's some drudgery involved.

04:17
Sometimes you feel like you're, um, now doing something uninteresting, and that's more than resistance.

04:24
And resilience kind of comes in as well. So those are those two things, really kind of balance out in, not each other out, and they motivate you, I think, in different ways.

04:34
How much have you had to use your teamwork skills in your profession?

04:40
A lot.

04:42
So, I-I-I don't have a huge lab but i have a number of people who work in my lab or doing research that are supported by my, by my grants, um.

04:51
And those people are, in addition to, you know, having to work with me, they have to work with each other.

04:57
And so we try to foster an environment that really supports that, where the the, whether there, you know, phd students or undergraduates or technicians, or wherever it is, they really feel like, um, they can celebrate each other's successes as well, that they're not competing with each other, but they're helping each other.

05:15
And so the ability to build a team and lead a team like that is, is super important.

05:21
Do you feel that there is, your profession is more complex than others?

05:30
I-I think by nature, of what we do there's some complexity involved you know Just when, you just hear the word neuroscience i think a lot of people's well their eyes start to roll back in their head it sounds.

05:46
Like a scary word, right?

05:48
And, and there is some complexity. It's kind of a different language sometimes that neuroscientists speak.

05:55
And there's some complexities, certainly what we do technically, the kind of like the kind of experiments that we do in the lab, some of those are really complex, um.

06:07
But I think if you also learn the ability to kind of break things down and present it at a more understandable level, I have to do that, E.G., when I teach.

06:16
So I don't just do research, but I also do a lot of teaching of medical students, graduate students, and that requires the ability to take some complex concepts and kind of break them down into smaller chunks that in a way that makes it more presentable and understandable as well.

06:36
And what challenges do you feel you faced when moving, transitioning and from being a student to becoming an assistant professor to So there are number of challenges, you know, the, the further, you know, in your career path, the higher the stakes become.

06:58
UM, so time management is always a challenge. UM, the ability to say, I'm gonna I-I need a chunk of time right here to work on this lecture or this series of lectures i need a chunk of time here to work on a paper that that I'm working on, or grant application.

07:14
Whatever it might be. So the ability to manage time is, is super important, and it's always, it's always a challenge.

07:21
There's a lot of different things that are kind of competing for your attention.

07:25
Um.

07:26
So, so that's a challenge.

07:30
The ability to obtain grant funding. And like I said, the stakes increase, right?

07:35
So, early career, maybe it's primarily me, was gonna suffer if I if I'm not able to maintain grand funding, which is a super competitive environment.

07:44
But now I've got people in my lab that I have to support as well, through my through, through those research grants.

07:50
And so that raises the stakes a little bit, right? When it's not just yourself, but there's some other people as well that that you're kind of responsible for, right?

07:59
And, um, concluding with this interview, um, do you feel, do you have any advice to me as a student trying to become a neurosurgeon?

08:15
Just know that it's, it's a long road, and there's gonna be a lot of ups and downs along the way.

08:23
But remember those, those two things, curiosity, curiosity will keep you going, I think, and, and then persistence and resilience.

08:33
Just realize that that's because something doesn't work the first time, just because the door seems like it's closed, the first time you try to open, it doesn't mean it's the end.

08:42
Doesn't mean of that aspiration. It just might mean the timing isn't quite right.

08:48
You have to keep at it and just be open to to new learning, and normally can along the way.

08:56
Thank you so much. And I appreciate you for actually, um, agreeing to be my mentor for this whole same project.

09:05
I know it was kind of last minute because I've had difficulty finding one in my specific, um, desire for career field.

09:14
So I really do appreciate you for taking your time out your day to meet with me through these Zoom calls.

09:20
Well, I enjoyed it secure. It was great to meet you and work with you a little bit on this.

09:25
And looks to me like you've all learned a lot in the process.

09:28
I hope you have. And, um, and I really enjoyed it.

09:32
Wish you nothing but the best going forward. Thank you so much.

09:35
I appreciate it. All right, take care.
