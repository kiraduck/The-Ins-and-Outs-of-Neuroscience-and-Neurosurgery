            <h2>Infographics</h2>
            <p>The infographics provide comprehensive insights into brain health, focusing on Alzheimer's disease, brain plasticity, and neurogenesis. The first infographic explains Alzheimer's as a brain disorder affecting memory, cognitive abilities, and daily tasks. It highlights symptoms like memory loss and confusion, along with statistics on its prevalence and mortality rate. Additionally, it mentions cognition-enhancing medications for treatment. The second infographic explores brain plasticity, detailing structural and functional plasticity and how neurons adapt through learning and recovery. It emphasizes activities like learning new skills, exercise, a healthy diet, meditation, and sleep to enhance neuroplasticity. The third infographic discusses neurogenesis, the formation of new neurons in the hippocampus, and its role in memory, mood, and brain plasticity. It outlines factors that hinder neurogenesis, such as stress, poor diet, and sleep deprivation, while providing tips for boosting neuron formation through exercise, brain foods, and lifelong learning. Together, these infographics highlight key aspects of brain function and ways to maintain cognitive health.</p>
