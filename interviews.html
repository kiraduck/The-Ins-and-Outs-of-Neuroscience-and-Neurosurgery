            <div>
                <h2>Interview Transcript with Professor Jim Fadel</h2>
                <p>00:00 We need to get my phd and, and go from there.</p>
                <p>00:03 That's what I did. I got my phd and then did a post doctoral fellowship, and then, and then got a faculty position here at the University of South Carolina.</p>
                <p>00:13 That's amazing. What who inspired you to go into the neuroscience field?</p>
                <p>00:20 That's a number of people, um, some of the people that I worked with well after I have in the labs that I worked with after finishing my undergraduate degree.</p>
                <p>00:30 They were very supportive, sometimes very challenging, but also always felt like I was learning a lot from them.</p>
                <p>00:40 And so they were, they were people who supported, supported me, supporting me going on to the next bank, whether it was graduate school or post doctoral fellowship or whatever.</p>
                <p>00:52 And then there, there's been some personal influences as well. You know, one of the things that I study is is cognitive function and aging and an alzheimer's disease.</p>
                <p>01:01 And my mother suffered from a dementia later in her life.</p>
                <p>01:06 And I so I experience that firsthand as as I seen a loved one suffer with that condition.</p>
                <p>01:14 And that provided additional motivation, I think, to do what I do right?</p>
                <p>01:20 And what, what skills do you believe every person or any student wanting to go into the neuroscience field as a whole should have?</p>
                <p>01:32 So I think a couple of things that are absolutely essential are curiosity.</p>
                <p>01:37 You need to be a curious person to become a scientist.</p>
                <p>01:40 Because, by definition, what you're doing is you're you're exploring things that aren't known.</p>
                <p>01:46 You're discovering new knowledge.</p>
                <p>01:48 And if you're not a curious person that's not going you're not gonna have that motivation to to do the next thing to do, the next experiment.</p>
                <p>01:56 Um, another thing is persistence. You you know, sometimes things don't work.</p>
                <p>02:01 Sometimes you gotta knock on a few doors before a door opens to you.</p>
                <p>02:07 And so just the ability to stick with something over an extended period of time.</p>
                <p>02:12 And, and if something doesn't work, to to get back at it and and try something else.</p>
                <p>02:18 So resilience and persistence are also key factors.</p>
                <p>02:23 That's great. And what do you believe, um, that the skills you acquired through your job?</p>
                <p>02:32 What skills do you believe you acquired while working as a professor?</p>
                <p>02:36 Well, I-I think some of those same skills and then there's additional skills as well that that, work in a variety of professions but are important for for what i do um the ability to work with a wide [...]</p>
                <p>02:50 Sometimes we think of scientists as people that are just kind of toiling away by themselves in a lab, and these weird individuals there occasionally come out of their whole and, but, but it the way sc[...]</p>
                <p>03:08 You have to work with a variety of different people and people who working, where you're working, working in your lab, or people who are outside of your lab that you're collaborating with.</p>
                <p>03:18 And so having those people skills, I think, is super important as well.</p>
                <p>03:22 And the more that you develop in your career, um, having some leadership skills helps as well.</p>
                <p>03:27 You're gonna be responsible for training people.</p>
                <p>03:30 And so providing an environment where people can learn, where they can make mistakes and then move forward and find success is really important.</p>
                <p>03:40 Well, um, do you believe that you are still having to grow in your profession?</p>
                <p>03:50 Absolutely. I learn new things everyday and, and that's really important.</p>
                <p>03:56 I think it ties back to that. That a trait of curiosity that I mentioned.</p>
                <p>04:02 I think if you're a curious person, then then you approach everyday as as, what can I learn today?</p>
                <p>04:08 And, you know, there's, and sometimes in science, as in any walk of life or any job, sometimes there's some drudgery involved.</p>
                <p>04:17 Sometimes you feel like you're, um, now doing something uninteresting, and that's more than resistance.</p>
                <p>04:24 And resilience kind of comes in as well. So those are those two things, really kind of balance out in, not each other out, and they motivate you, I think, in different ways.</p>
                <p>04:34 How much have you had to use your teamwork skills in your profession?</p>
                <p>04:40 A lot.</p>
                <p>04:42 So, I-I-I don't have a huge lab but i have a number of people who work in my lab or doing research that are supported by my, by my grants, um.</p>
                <p>04:51 And those people are, in addition to, you know, having to work with me, they have to work with each other.</p>
                <p>04:57 And so we try to foster an environment that really supports that, where the the, whether there, you know, phd students or undergraduates or technicians, or wherever it is, they really feel like, um, t[...]</p>
                <p>05:15 And so the ability to build a team and lead a team like that is, is super important.</p>
                <p>05:21 Do you feel that there is, your profession is more complex than others?</p>
                <p>05:30 I-I think by nature, of what we do there's some complexity involved you know Just when, you just hear the word neuroscience i think a lot of people's well their eyes start to roll back in their head i[...]</p>
                <p>05:46 Like a scary word, right?</p>
                <p>05:48 And, and there is some complexity. It's kind of a different language sometimes that neuroscientists speak.</p>
                <p>05:55 And there's some complexities, certainly what we do technically, the kind of like the kind of experiments that we do in the lab, some of those are really complex, um.</p>
                <p>06:07 But I think if you also learn the ability to kind of break things down and present it at a more understandable level, I have to do that, E.G., when I teach.</p>
                <p>06:16 So I don't just do research, but I also do a lot of teaching of medical students, graduate students, and that requires the ability to take some complex concepts and kind of break them down into smalle[...]</p>
                <p>06:36 And what challenges do you feel you faced when moving, transitioning and from being a student to becoming an assistant professor to So there are number of challenges, you know, the, the further, you k[...]</p>
                <p>06:58 UM, so time management is always a challenge. UM, the ability to say, I'm gonna I-I need a chunk of time right here to work on this lecture or this series of lectures i need a chunk of time here to wo[...]</p>
                <p>07:14 Whatever it might be. So the ability to manage time is, is super important, and it's always, it's always a challenge.</p>
                <p>07:21 There's a lot of different things that are kind of competing for your attention.</p>
                <p>07:25 Um.</p>
                <p>07:26 So, so that's a challenge.</p>
                <p>07:30 The ability to obtain grant funding. And like I said, the stakes increase, right?</p>
                <p>07:35 So, early career, maybe it's primarily me, was gonna suffer if I if I'm not able to maintain grand funding, which is a super competitive environment.</p>
                <p>07:44 But now I've got people in my lab that I have to support as well, through my through, through those research grants.</p>
                <p>07:50 And so that raises the stakes a little bit, right? When it's not just yourself, but there's some other people as well that that you're kind of responsible for, right?</p>
                <p>07:59 And, um, concluding with this interview, um, do you feel, do you have any advice to me as a student trying to become a neurosurgeon?</p>
                <p>08:15 Just know that it's, it's a long road, and there's gonna be a lot of ups and downs along the way.</p>
                <p>08:23 But remember those, those two things, curiosity, curiosity will keep you going, I think, and, and then persistence and resilience.</p>
                <p>08:33 Just realize that that's because something doesn't work the first time, just because the door seems like it's closed, the first time you try to open, it doesn't mean it's the end.</p>
                <p>08:42 Doesn't mean of that aspiration. It just might mean the timing isn't quite right.</p>
                <p>08:48 You have to keep at it and just be open to to new learning, and normally can along the way.</p>
                <p>08:56 Thank you so much. And I appreciate you for actually, um, agreeing to be my mentor for this whole same project.</p>
                <p>09:05 I know it was kind of last minute because I've had difficulty finding one in my specific, um, desire for career field.</p>
                <p>09:14 So I really do appreciate you for taking your time out your day to meet with me through these Zoom calls.</p>
                <p>09:20 Well, I enjoyed it secure. It was great to meet you and work with you a little bit on this.</p>
                <p>09:25 And looks to me like you've all learned a lot in the process.</p>
                <p>09:28 I hope you have. And, um, and I really enjoyed it.</p>
                <p>09:32 Wish you nothing but the best going forward. Thank you so much.</p>
                <p>09:35 I appreciate it. All right, take care.</p>
                  <h2>Interview with Dr. Jen, Assistant Professor of Neuroscience at MUSC</h2>
            <p><strong>Interviewer (Kira):</strong> Thank you, Dr. Jen, for taking the time to speak with me today. To start, can you tell me a little about your current role at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC)?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Jen:</strong> Of course! Right now, I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Neuroscience at MUSC. Unlike most traditional universities, MUSC is a standalone medical and graduate educational institution, which means we don’t have undergraduate students on campus. My role is primarily research-focused, though I do some teaching as well. My work revolves around studying neuroscience, particularly how different factors influence addiction and substance use.</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer (Kira):</strong> That sounds fascinating! What was your educational journey like? How did you get to where you are today?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Jen:</strong> It was quite a long journey, but I have always enjoyed learning, so I didn’t mind all the schooling. I grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan, and attended Western Michigan University for my undergraduate studies. At the time, there wasn’t a neuroscience major available, so I double-majored in biology and psychology. While in college, I had the opportunity to work in a research lab, which was my first exposure to the world of scientific research. I didn’t even know it was a career option before then!</p>
            <p>After college, I moved to Washington, DC, and attended American University, where I earned both my Master’s and Doctorate in Neuroscience. My research there focused on how different parts of the brain control our responses to substances like alcohol and nicotine. One specific question I explored was why some people, known as social smokers, only smoke when they drink. Understanding the brain mechanisms behind these behaviors is crucial because excessive smoking and drinking can be harmful to one’s health.</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer (Kira):</strong> That’s really interesting! So after completing your doctorate, what were your next steps in your career?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Jen:</strong> After finishing my Ph.D., I worked at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill for a few years before moving to MUSC. My research has continued to focus on understanding addiction, particularly how stress influences alcohol consumption and addiction. My team and I work on identifying potential drug treatments to help individuals control their drinking, make healthier choices, and even reverse some of the brain damage caused by excessive alcohol exposure.</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer (Kira):</strong> It’s amazing how your research can have real-world applications for improving health. What initially drew you to neuroscience and addiction research?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Jen:</strong> I’ve always been fascinated by the brain—how it controls everything we do, think, and feel. When I first started in research, I became particularly interested in how substances like alcohol and nicotine affect brain function and behavior. Addiction is such a complex issue, influenced by biological, psychological, and environmental factors, and I wanted to contribute to a better understanding of it. Ultimately, the goal is to help people live healthier lives by developing treatments that can reduce substance abuse and its harmful effects.</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer (Kira):</strong> That’s incredible. It sounds like a rewarding field to be in. Thank you for sharing your journey and insights with me. Would you be open to a follow-up discussion over Zoom to explore more ideas for my project?</p>
            <p><strong>Dr. Jen:</strong> Absolutely! I’d be happy to chat more and help in any way I can. Just let me know when you’d like to set up a time!</p>
            <p><strong>Interviewer (Kira):</strong> Great! I’ll follow up soon. Thank you again, Dr. Jen!</p>
