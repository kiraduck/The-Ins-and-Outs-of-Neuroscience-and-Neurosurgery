            <img src="Kiraa.jpeg" alt="Kiras photo" />
            <p>Throughout the process of creating this webpage, I have gained a deeper understanding of the field of neuroscience and neurosurgery. Each section of the site allowed me to dive into different aspects of neuroscience, from neurogenesis to different careers in the field. I have learned about the latest research and advancements, and the complex mechanisms that underlie brain function and disorders.</p>
            <p>One of the key takeaways from this project is the importance of continuous learning and staying updated with new research. Neuroscience is a rapidly evolving field, and it is crucial to keep aware of new discoveries and their implications for treatment and patient care. This project has also highlighted the versatile nature of neuroscience, involving biology, medicine, psychology, and even technology.</p>
            <h2>Reinforcing My Aspiration to Become a Neurosurgeon</h2>
            <p>Working on this project has not only enhanced my knowledge but has also strengthened my decesion to pursue a career in neurosurgery. The complexity of the brain and the potential to make a significant impact on patients' lives are incredibly motivating. Creating this webpage has given me a glimpse into the world of neuroscience and reaffirmed my passion for this field.</p>
            <p>I am now more determined than ever to continue my studies and eventually become a neurosurgeon. The journey ahead is challenging, but I am excited to take on this challenge and contribute to the field of neuroscience and neurosurgery.</p>
