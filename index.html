            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>My final product for Senior Project is a webpage. This webpage includes interviews from people in the neuroscience field that chose different paths, infographics that include information about major neurological diseases, along with a deeper dive into how these diseases grow and work. My webpage will showcase my interest in Neuroscience and the sub-field of Neurosurgery. It will also show my growth in knowledge of the Neuroscience and Neurosurgery field.</p>
